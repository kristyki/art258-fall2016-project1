        On November 17th, iconic graffiti artist FUTURA will turn 60. To celebrate his birhtday and decades worth of artistic output, MONTANA-CANS have created a special colorway, the FUTURA 2000 Black, as part of their Iconic Series. For the global pre-launch, FUTURA asked his friends at ACRONYM to collaborate on an exclusive design to appear on the can, produced in a limited run and for this occasion only.
